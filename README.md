We want to create an AI-powered shopping list tracker that scans objects and automatically checks and crosses the items out on a list. The problem being solved is the hassle of forgetting to pick up items or having to manually cross them out on a physical list or deleting them off a notes app. This is traditionally solved by paper lists that can easily get lost or misplaced and notes app which arent organized. The target audience are everyday shoppers who go through this issue weekly.

This project has one primary feature that sets it apart from others which is the AI computer vision which automatically detects what object it is looking at. Other sub features can be the ability to save templates for grocery lists so the user doesnt have to keep inputting the same items each time they go shopping. It also has the ability to save past lists to see what the user has bought before.
